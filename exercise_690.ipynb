    "\n",
    "We saw that the classifier could get to 97% accuracy on Toy Problem 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In exercise 680, we saw that if we **used a sigmoid** instead of the ReLU, the classifier would not learn anything.\n",

    "Now, we use a sigmoid again, but also use a bias in addition to the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the bias gives the classifier more power (it learns the XOR function or Toy Problem 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've provided a utility class 'Data' (in data_reader.py) to load the training data (it works for all the toy problems)."
