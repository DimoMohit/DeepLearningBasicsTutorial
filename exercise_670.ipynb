    "In exercise 630, we built a single layer classifier for Toy Problem 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that for the single-layer neural network, the loss did not decrease despite the prolonged use of gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in Toy Problem 3 was a version of the XOR function -the categories in this data set are not linearly separable - and so it is impossible for a single-layer neural network (or any other linear classifier) to do well on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's build a multi-layer classifier for Toy Problem 3 using the ReLU non-linearity (which was discovered/invented only in the year 2000) and see how it fares.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've provided a utility class 'Data' (in data_reader.py) to load the training data (it works for all the toy problems)."
