# Doer's Deep Learning Course.

I assume that you like me don't enjoy having to stare at equations on a blackboard, that you would rather be working through exercises that help you understand a subject.

These exercises use toy problems to walk you through the basics of deep learning.

Hopefully, in doing these exercises and observing how various algorithms fare on the toy problems, you'll also come to understand the subject a lot better than you would from a book.
