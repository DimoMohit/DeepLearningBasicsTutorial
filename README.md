# Deep Learning through Pytorch Exercises
Learn the basics of deep learning by working through a series of exercises using the Pytorch framework for deep learning.
It is possible to gain a better understanding of deep learning theory by working through a series of simple exercises.  The exercises use a number of toy datasets to demonstrate the capabilities of various kinds of deep learning models for supervised learning.  The exercises are written in Python and use the Pytorch framework for deep learning.
