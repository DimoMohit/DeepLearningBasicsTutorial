# Deep Learning Basics

I assume that you like me don't enjoy having to stare at equations on a blackboard, and would rather be working through exercises that help you understand a subject.

These exercises use toy problems to walk you through the basics of deep learning.  Hopefully, you will learn the subject by doing experiments and observing how various algorithms fare on the toy problems, and come to understand things a lot better than you would learning from a book.
