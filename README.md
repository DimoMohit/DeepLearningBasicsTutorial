T Deep Learning Basics

I assume that you, like me, don't enjoy having to stare at equations on a blackboard, and would rather be working through exercises that help you understand a subject.

These exercises use toy problems to walk you through the basics of deep learning.  Hopefully, you will find it satisfying to learn the subject by doing experiments and observing how various algorithms fare on the toy problems.

# Getting Started

If you have git installed, download all the exercises by issuing the following command:

*git clone https://github.com/aiaioo/DeepLearningBasicsTutorial/*

If you do not have git installed, just grab the slides DeepLearningBasics.pptx.

You will be able to commence learning about deep learning immediately.

# Motivation

You are really lucky to be learning (or teaching) machine learning at this time because deep learning has made machine learning a very easy subject to learn.

How many of you are scared of mathematics … at least sometimes?

Well, you’re in the right class, because you need very little math to learn this subject.

How many of you know how to multiply two numbers?

Ok!

How many of you know division?

Great!

That’s all the math you will need!

And with just that little bit of math, you’ll build a chatbot by the end of this lecture.
