# Deep Learning Basics

I assume that you like me don't enjoy having to stare at equations on a blackboard, that you would rather be working through exercises that help you understand a subject.

These exercises use toy problems to walk you through the basics of deep learning.  Hopefully, you will learn the subject by doing things in a not-at-all-intimidating environment.  Hopefully, in doing these exercises and observing how various algorithms fare on the toy problems, you'll also come to understand the subject a lot better than you would from a book.
