# Deep Learning Basics

I assume that you, like me, don't enjoy having to stare at equations on a blackboard, and would rather be working through exercises that help you understand a subject.

These exercises use toy problems to walk you through the basics of deep learning.  Hopefully, you will find it satisfying to learn the subject by doing experiments and observing how various algorithms fare on the toy problems.

# Getting Started

If you have git installed, download all the exercises by issuing the following command:

*git clone https://github.com/aiaioo/DeepLearningBasicsTutorial/*

If you donT have git installed, just grab the slides DeepLearningBasics.pptx.

You will be able to commence learning about deep learning immediately.
